### ✨ Hi! Nice to meet you! ✨

My name is Mareike and I am a web developer. 👩‍💻
- 👑 My pronouns are **she/ her**.
- 💡 I'm a **career changer**: my journey began in 2021 with a **web development bootcamp**.
- 💻 Since January 2022 I have been working as a **web development coach** and **web developer**.
- 🫀 My heart beats for **well-structured, comprehensible code** and **testing**!
- 🎨 Before my career change, I worked as an **art historian** and wrote my doctoral thesis on the depiction of carved trees in early British expedition accounts of Australia.

🌱 **Current Learning Projects**

I'm always excited to learn new things! Here are my projects I'm currently working on to expand my skills:
- 🌿 [Nature's Nook](https://github.com/mbosselmann/natures-nook): A plant shop prototype to dive deeper into microservices.
- 👻 [Haunted Canvas](https://github.com/mbosselmann/haunted-canvas): My first Angular project, an image editor for creating spooky, ghostly images. 
- 🔥 [Pyropoly](https://github.com/mbosselmann/pyropoly): A Next.js app to build a "Monopoly on Fire" version with the future goal to go from a single-player to a multiplayer game. 


Feel free to explore these projects and join me on my learning journey!
