### ✨ Hi! Nice to meet you! ✨

My name is Mareike and I am a frontend developer. 👩‍💻
- 👑 My pronouns are **she/ her**.
- 💡 I'm a **career changer**: my journey began in 2021 with a **web development bootcamp**.
- 💻 Since January 2022 I have been working as a **web development coach** and **web developer**.
- 🫀 My heart beats for **well-structured, comprehensible code and testing**!
- 🎨 Before my career change, I worked as an **art historian** and wrote my doctoral thesis on the depiction of carved trees in early British expedition accounts of Australia.
